As a Computer Science enthusiast, I am deeply passionate about the rapid evolution of technology. Proficient in a diverse array of programming languages such as Java and JavaScript, I continuously strive to broaden my technical skill set. My expertise extends to frameworks like Node.js and Spring, which complement my role as a Web Developer specializing in backend technologies. Presently, I am delving into the realms of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, eager to harness these cutting-edge fields to drive innovation and create intelligent solutions.
