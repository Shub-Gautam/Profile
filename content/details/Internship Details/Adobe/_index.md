### Overview

<!-- {{< youtube 0RKpf3rK57I >}} -->

I summer interned at Adobe as a CXM Intern which comes under the umberella of Adobe Digital Experience cloud, whose main aim is to provide development and maintenance to enterprise softwares for customers.

During my internship period of 2.5 months [apr 2023 - jul 2023] I worked on a varity of tech stack and tools including MS Power suit, Machine Learning, Web application. I primaraly worked on 2 projects, one of which is a ML Model to predict relevant engineer for tickets comming on zendesk. The response of this project was great and the company want us to expand this solution to other CRMs,
this result in extending our internship duration to 2 months [aug 2023 - nov 2023] more.

Further details about the projects is present in the presentation.
