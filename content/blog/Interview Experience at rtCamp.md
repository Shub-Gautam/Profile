I applied for Software Engineer (Trainee) at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com) through their company portal, this is a off-campus drive, 
(4 Jun) I got a mail from rtCamp team, that my resume is shortlisted for the role and want to move forward with me. 
My interview got scheduled on 5 Jun 11AM, inteview mode was virtual, First I have to wait in the Introduction meeting on zoom along with other candidates, I don't really remember how many candidates were present with me at the time but the count was in double digit.

The HR also present in the meet and she is taking a brief introduction of everyone and sending us one by one to the interview room for the 1st Technical Interview.

**Techical Interview 1**

We first introduce ourself then we talked a little bit about my previous experience and project then move to question, the questions mainly related to Core concepts and System Design, I was expection DSA but that was not the case, the questions were from many topics including Databases, React, Encryption, Hashing, some simple design questions, differences between multiple technologies, some use case question etc. I am able to ans all the question, it took approx 30 mins then another interviewer join the meet and he starts asking questions mainly from system design prespective, some of the questions were 

* Design a captcha Service
  - How to generate a Captcha 
  - How to store and send these captcha efficiently
  - what services you are going to use
* Designing Youtube
  - How youtube decides the playback quality of the video currently playing
  - How youtube manages to handle these multiple quality versions
  - what do you prefer, pre-computed different quality of the video or render the video on the fly, how do you support your preference.
* Design Elevator Algorithms for different types of elevators

Most of the discussion was based on High Level Design of these senerios, during this time other interviewer also joined and asked questions regarding my approach and design, this interview kept going on for 1 hr 40 min, after which my interviewer told me that they are shifting me to another meeting room for second round. 

**Techical Interview 2**

The interviewer panel was same and we started our second round of interview, in which simple questions on react were asked, regarding Virtual DOM, States and Props, shadow element in CSS, I told my interviewer that I am not comfortable with react or with frontend, that I am more focused on backend technologies, then they asked another System Design question, this is a simple one not like the previous design questions. Then they asked me some managerial questions, I am able to gave answer to almost all of the questions except for the frontend. The interviewer told me that they want me to move to the HR meeting room where they extend me an offer and tells me about the company and feedback from the interviewers (They were satisfied by my Problem solving and Design concepts but tells me to improve on my frontend skills which I agreed) 

on the same day I got the offer letter
