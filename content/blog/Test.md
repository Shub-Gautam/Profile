System design is an important part while working on a project, a good design will help you to build a robust, scalable and maintainable project. I started learining System Design when I was in 3rd year of my B.Tech Degree, and these are my pick to read.

**1. System Design Interview by Alex Yu (ByteByteGo)**

Awsome book for High Level Design, It consists of multiple real world example.
